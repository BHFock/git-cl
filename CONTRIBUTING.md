# Contributing to git-cl

Thanks for your interest in [git-cl](https://github.com/BHFock/git-cl)! This project is **feature complete** â€” all planned functionality has been implemented. Future development focuses on **maintenance, bug fixes, and usability improvements** rather than new features.

## Project Status
git-cl is a stable, focused tool with a clear scope. While I appreciate feature ideas, I'm **not actively seeking new functionality**. The tool does what it was designed to do well, and I prefer to keep it that way.

## How You Can Help

### Bug Reports

**Most valuable contribution!** If you find issues:

- Check existing GitHub issues first
- Include your Python version, OS, and git-cl version (`git cl --version`)
- Provide steps to reproduce the problem
- Include relevant error messages or unexpected behaviour

### Documentation Improvements

Small documentation fixes and clarifications are welcome:

- Typos, broken links, unclear explanations
- Missing examples for existing features
- FAQ additions based on real user questions

### Testing & Compatibility Reports

Help ensure git-cl works across different environments:

- Report compatibility issues with different Python/Git versions
- Test on different operating systems
- Share edge cases you've encountered

## What I'm Not Looking For

To keep the project focused and maintainable:

- New features or commands
- Major architectural changes
- Integration with external tools (IDEs, CI systems, etc.)
- Alternative file formats or storage backends
- GUI or web interfaces

## Before Opening an Issue

- **Read the documentation:** Check the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) and FAQ section
- **Try the latest version:** Download the current script to rule out already-fixed [issues](https://github.com/BHFock/git-cl/issues)
- **Search existing issues:** Your question might already be answered

## Development Philosophy

git-cl follows the Unix philosophy: **do one thing well**. It brings SVN-style changelists to Git, nothing more. This focused scope is intentional and helps keep the tool reliable and understandable.

## Response Expectations

I maintain git-cl in my spare time. I'll do my best to:

- Respond to bug reports
- Fix genuine bugs as time permits
- Consider documentation improvements

However, I may not respond to feature requests or questions already covered in the documentation.

Thanks for helping keep [git-cl](https://github.com/BHFock/git-cl) stable and useful!
